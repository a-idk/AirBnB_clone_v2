# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework
Web framework Project:
A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides a standard way to build and deploy web applications by offering reusable code components and tools for handling common web development tasks such as URL routing, input validation, session management, and database integration.
Some popular web frameworks include:

A. Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

B. Flask: A lightweight Python web framework that is simple and easy to use, yet powerful enough to build complex web applications.

C. Ruby on Rails: A full-stack web framework for the Ruby programming language, known for its convention over configuration approach and emphasis on developer productivity.

D. Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, allowing developers to build scalable and robust web applications.

E. ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform, high-performance web framework for building modern, cloud-based applications using the .NET platform.

F. Laravel: A PHP web framework that provides elegant syntax and tools for building modern web applications, emphasizing developer productivity and code maintainability.
